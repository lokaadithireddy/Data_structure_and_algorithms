# Active Directory

Searching for user in a group can be done recursively as it has to iterate through groups in a hierarchy. 



# Time and Space Complexity

Time complexity is O(n1 X n2). 

n1 being number of levels.

n2 being number of users under each level.


Space complexity is O(n1 X n2). 

n1 being number of levels.

n2 being number of users under each level.
