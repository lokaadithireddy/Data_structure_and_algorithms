# Block Chain

I created a Blockchain class where each node has a block, next pointer and tail pointer.

Data is appended by creating new block with respective timestamp and previous hash.

It hashes the information and new block is therefore added to the chain.

# Time and Space Complexity

Time complexity is O(n) for iterating over block chain and appending data.

Space complexity is O(n) for storing size of data
