# Union and Intersection

Union and Intersection tasks can be done using set() data structure 

Because, set doesn't allow duplicates.

All the values of linkedlist are added to set.

And later, linkedlist can be created from set.

# Time and Space Complexity

For both union and intersection,

Time complexity is O(n) as we are parsing through all the elements of a list just once.

Also, set function use hash tables (which are O(n))

Space Complexity is O(n).

I used list to store all values after union and intersection is done.
