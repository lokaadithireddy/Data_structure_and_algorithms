Inorder to determine the two numbers that can give maximum value. I checked if the given input is none or
a single number.If so, returned the given list. In other scenarios, I have sorted the list in ascending order using
merge sort and performed calculation on the every altenative number starting from 0  to determine the first number and
index 1 to determine second number that could give maximum sum.

Time Complexity: O(n logn)
Space Complexity:O(n)
