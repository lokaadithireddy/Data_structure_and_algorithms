Since we are required to find the min and max in single traversal, I have used 2 variables min and max 
and assigned them the maximum and minimum possible value.I updated the minimum and maximum variable 
whenever we encounter a number that is smaller and greater than the current minimum and current maximum.


Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
