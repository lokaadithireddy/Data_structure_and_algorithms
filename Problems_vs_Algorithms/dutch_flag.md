Inorder to sort 0,1,2 in single traversal, I have used three pointer technique. I have inititalized the 
pointers as represented in the solution. I have swapped the values when they are misplaced and incremented
or decremented the pointers according to the conditions represnted in the solution.This process is continued till the pointer named (mid) is lesser than or
equal to pointer named high.



Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
